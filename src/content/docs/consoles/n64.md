## Display Mods

### HDMI Output

- **RetroGEM** (PixelFX) — Universal internal HDMI mod kit covering N64, PS1, and PS2. Widely discussed in the community; active firmware development ongoing. Note: toggling overclock via long reset conflicts with EverDrive menu behavior — a known interaction to be aware of. [Buy · Stone Age Gamer](https://stoneagegamer.com/retro-gem-universal-hdmi-upscaler-kit-for-ps1-ps2-n64-pixelfx.html) · [PixelFX site](https://pixelfx.co) → [Full details](/projects/retrogem)

- **N64Digital** (PixelFX) — N64-specific internal HDMI output board. Separate product from the RetroGEM; community members tracked N64Digital and RetroGEM compatibility and priority for updates. [Buy · PixelFX](https://pixelfx.co/n64digital) → [Full details](/projects/n64digital)

### S-Video / RGB

- **Insurrection Industries Double-Shielded S-Video Cable** — Quality S-Video cable covering SNES, N64, and GameCube. Discussed as a solid analog output option before committing to HDMI mods. [Buy · Stone Age Gamer](https://stoneagegamer.com/super-nintendo-n64-gamecube-s-video-cable.html)

- N64 RGB output is revision-dependent. Early NTSC boards have RGB on the multi-out; later revisions (common in the US) require a separate RGB mod.

## Storage / Flash Carts

- **EverDrive 64 X5 / X7** (Krikzz) — SD-based flash carts with broad game compatibility. The X5 covers the core N64 library at a lower price point; the X7 adds a faster processor and additional features. Discussed in the community in the context of N64 overclock firmware interactions — the long-reset overclock toggle can conflict with EverDrive menu behavior when paired with RetroGEM or N64Digital.

- **64drive** (retroactive) — FPGA-based alternative flash cart. Considered a premium option; known for accuracy. [Product site](https://64drive.retroactive.be/)

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Expansion Pak slot** — The expansion pak slot can develop contact issues over time; cleaning restores reliability. An open-source FRAM-based Memory Pak alternative has also been developed. [GitHub – N64 FRAM Memory Pak](https://github.com/Element18592/N64-FRAM-Memory-Pak)

- **Cartridge connector** — Pin oxidation is common. Cleaning with IPA or contact cleaner restores contact. Community members noted the RetroBlaster as a preferred cartridge reader for ROM backup.

- **Power supply** — OEM power supplies age and can cause instability. Aftermarket replacements are available; quality varies. Community discussed AliExpress units as an option.

- **Capacitors** — Audio and power caps on aging boards may need replacement.

### Capacitor Replacement

- Standard electrolytic caps on the main board and power supply board are worth checking on older units. The N64 power supply board is a commonly noted failure point.

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **Replacement Shells (3D Printed)** — RetroGameRevival on Printables offers a Nintendo 64 DD replacement shell. Community members discussed printing in custom colors. [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1145937-nintendo-64-dd-replacement-shell)

- **Renaissance N64 Project** (Rocker Gaming) — Controller redesign and accessories project for the N64. Includes the "Steel Bowl" bowl replacement and other components. Multiple community mentions. [Buy · Rocker Gaming](https://shop.rockergaming.com/collections/renaissance-n64)

## Controllers

- **GC Ultimate 2** (Mitch HHL) — Open-source, repair-friendly controller with hall effect sticks and triggers, gyro, analog triggers, and native Steam support. Designed for GameCube and N64 (and Nintendo Switch). Crowdfunding as of early 2026. [gcultimate.com](https://gcultimate.com) → [Full details](/projects/gc-ultimate-2)

- **BlueRetro RetroTime N64** — Internal BlueRetro wireless adapter for N64 with Memory Pak functionality. Adds Bluetooth wireless support without requiring external adapters. [Buy · Stone Age Gamer](https://stoneagegamer.com/retrotime-n64-blueretro-with-memory-pak-for-nintendo-64.html)

- **N64 Project Renaissance Tao V4** — Redesigned analog stick replacement for the original N64 controller. The original stick mechanism is a known weak point; this addresses the core wear problem. Available on Etsy (search "Renaissance Tao N64").

- **8BitDo N64 Controller** — Wireless N64-style controller. Noted by Dubesinhower in the community with some reservations — worth researching current reviews before purchasing. [8BitDo site](https://www.8bitdo.com/n64-controller/)
