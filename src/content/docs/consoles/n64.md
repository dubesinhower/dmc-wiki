## Display Mods

### S-Video / RGB

- **Insurrection Industries Double-Shielded S-Video Cable** — Quality S-Video cable covering SNES, N64, and GameCube. Discussed as a solid analog output option before committing to HDMI mods. [Buy · Stone Age Gamer](https://stoneagegamer.com/super-nintendo-n64-gamecube-s-video-cable.html)

- N64 RGB output is revision-dependent. Early NTSC boards have RGB on the multi-out; later revisions (common in the US) require a separate RGB mod.

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Expansion Pak slot** — The expansion pak slot can develop contact issues over time; cleaning restores reliability. An open-source FRAM-based Memory Pak alternative has also been developed. [GitHub – N64 FRAM Memory Pak](https://github.com/Element18592/N64-FRAM-Memory-Pak)

- **Cartridge connector** — Pin oxidation is common. Cleaning with IPA or contact cleaner restores contact. Community members noted the RetroBlaster as a preferred cartridge reader for ROM backup.

- **Power supply** — OEM power supplies age and can cause instability. Aftermarket replacements are available; quality varies. Community discussed AliExpress units as an option.

- **Capacitors** — Audio and power caps on aging boards may need replacement.

### Capacitor Replacement

- Standard electrolytic caps on the main board and power supply board are worth checking on older units. The N64 power supply board is a commonly noted failure point.
