## Display Mods

### HDMI Output

- **RetroGEM** (PixelFX) — Universal HDMI upscaler kit covering PS1, PS2, and N64. Internal installation; widely discussed in the community. Available from Stone Age Gamer and direct. Community members noted tracking GEM + N64 Digital compatibility and priority for updates.
- **N64Digital** (PixelFX) — N64-specific HDMI output board. Community member Cien mentioned having a GEM N64 and watching this space. Discussed alongside overclock support questions.
- Both HDMI solutions were noted to have active firmware development; community member starlightk7 flagged that toggling overclock via long reset conflicts with Everdrive menu behavior and GEM/N64digital integration.

### S-Video / RGB

- **Insurrection Industries Double-Shielded S-Video Cable** — Discussed as a quality S-Video option for SNES/N64/GameCube. Available from Stone Age Gamer.
- N64 RGB output is revision-dependent; early NTSC boards have RGB on the multi-out; later revisions require a mod.

## Storage / Flash Carts

- **EverDrive 64 X7** (Krikzz) — SD-based flash cart with broad compatibility. Discussed in context of N64 overclock firmware interactions.
- **64drive** — FPGA-based alternative flash cart.

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Expansion Pak slot** — The expansion pak slot can develop contact issues; cleaning restores reliability. An open-source FRAM Memory Pak alternative was shared from [GitHub (Element18592)](https://github.com/Element18592/N64-FRAM-Memory-Pak).
- **Expansion Pak RAM** — For those looking to build or replace: an open-source Expansion Pak update was shared from the r/n64 community tracking RAM part numbers and compatibility. See [BitBuilt thread](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/n64-expansion-paks-ram-part-numbers.3943/).
- **Cartridge connector** — Pin oxidation is common; cleaning with IPA or contact cleaner. Community members noted N64 cartridge readers (RetroBlaster) as an alternative for ROM backup.
- **Power supply failure** — OEM power supplies age; community discussed AliExpress aftermarket supplies.
- **Capacitors** — Audio and power caps on aging boards may need replacement.

### Capacitor Replacement

- Standard electrolytic caps on the main board and power supply board are worth checking on older units. The N64 power supply board is a common failure point.

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **Replacement Shells (3D Printed)** — RetroGameRevival on Printables offers a Nintendo 64 DD replacement shell for printed options. Community members discussed printing them in custom colors.
- **Renaissance N64 Project** (Rocker Gaming) — A community-discussed controller redesign and accessories project for the N64. "Renaissance N64 Steel Bowl" and other components available at [shop.rockergaming.com](https://shop.rockergaming.com/collections/renaissance-n64). Community member RayneX shared these links multiple times.

## Controllers

- **BlueRetro RetroTime N64** — Internal BlueRetro wireless adapter for N64 with Memory Pak. Available from Stone Age Gamer.
- **BITFUNX RetroScaler N64 Wireless Adapter** — Allows modern controllers to be used on N64. Discussed with mixed feedback.
- **8BitDo N64 Controller** — Referenced by Dubesinhower in community; he noted regretting his purchase.
- **N64 Project Renaissance Tao V4** — A redesigned analog stick replacement for the original controller. Discussed on Etsy in the community.
- Community member Vuscav noted wanting a good aftermarket N64 controller; the original stick mechanism is a known weak point.

## Community Notes

- N64 was described by community members as "on a whole new level" of difficulty for HDMI modding compared to Famicom and Genesis (noted by RayneX).
- Community discussion noted that MiSTer N64 core support was once considered "impossible" but has since been achieved.
- A fan-made PC recompilation of "Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon" for N64 was shared in community links (via GBAtemp).
- A prototype for adding a USB port to N64 carts was shared from [lambertjamesd GitHub](https://github.com/lambertjamesd/n64-usb).
- N64 cartridge reading with the RetroBlaster was specifically mentioned by JesusBurnsNeon as his choice over the OSCR.
- An N64 portable built inside a Game Gear shell was shared from BitBuilt forums as a community project highlight.
