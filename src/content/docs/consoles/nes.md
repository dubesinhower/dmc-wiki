## Display Mods

### RGB Output

- **NESRGB** (Tim Worthington) — Internal RGB mod kit for the NES/Famicom. Widely discussed in the community as a long-standing solution. Discussed alongside OpenTendo compatibility in the Discord.
- **Hi-Def NES** (Analogue) — HDMI output mod for the NES front-loader. Discontinued but still circulated secondhand. Adds HDMI output with scanline options.
- **OpenTendo** — Open-source NES mainboard replacement project. Referenced in community discussion around NESRGB integration.

### Composite / AV Restoration

- **POW Block AV/Power Board for NES Front Loader** (zaxour) — Replacement AV and power board for the NES front-loader. Available via zaxour's Ko-fi shop.
- **NES Power Module Redesign** (ShawMerlin) — GitHub project redesigning the NES power module, including an RGB–Genesis 9-pin edition variant for RGB output. See [GitHub](https://github.com/ShawMerlin/NES-Power-Module-Redesign).

## Storage / Flash Carts

- **EverDrive N8 Pro** (Krikzz) — SD-based flash cart for NES/Famicom. Community members noted using new firmware after receiving units.
- **PowerPak** (RetroZone) — Earlier flash cart option; less discussed in recent community threads.
- **FDS2NES** — PCB adapter that converts a Famicom Disk System RAM adapter (HVC-023) into a cart-slot solution. Discussed via eBay listing in the community.
- **Low Budget Super 8 Bit v4.1** — NES-compatible game console PCB available on Tindie; discussed as a budget-tier compatible board alternative.

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **72-pin connector (front-loader)** — The ZIF connector degrades over time, causing blinking/grey screen issues. Boiling, bending, or replacing the connector are common approaches.
- **PPU / CPU clock crystal** — Can drift on aging boards, causing audio or sync problems.
- **Power LED** — Fails on some units; straightforward LED swap.
- **Cartridge connector oxidation** — Common on Famicom edge connectors; cleaning with IPA restores contact.

### Capacitor Replacement

- The Famicom board uses electrolytic capacitors that can leak or fail. Recapping is particularly relevant for audio quality, especially on units with the external sound expansion connector used by mappers like FDS and VRC6.

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **Famicom cartridge shells** (Muramasa Entertainment) — Translucent replacement cartridge shells for Famicom carts. Available directly from Muramasa's store.
- **MouseBiteLabs NES Cartridge PCBs** — Open-source cartridge PCBs for NES discrete logic mappers. See [GitHub](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/NES-Cartridges/tree/main/Discrete%20Logic%20Mappers). Useful for repro builds.
- **FamiCoun** (jeffqchen) — Famicom front-expansion to NES/SNES adapter. Open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffqchen/FamiCoun-Famicom-Front-Expansion-NES-SNES-Adapter).
- **Top-loader NES shell mods** — Top-loader (NES-101) shells are generally considered better-aging than the front-loader; shell replacement options exist from various third parties.
