## Overview

Vue After Free is a userland exploit for the PlayStation 4 that leverages the PlayStation Vue streaming application (CUSA00960) to achieve code execution via **CVE-2017-7117**. It chains the userland exploit with either the **Lapse** or **Netctrl (Poopsploit)** kernel exploit to achieve a full jailbreak.

The exploit loads jailbreak data from the console's HDD via a modified save file. A custom UI provides a payload menu, theme support, and auto-run options. A **Lite** build is also available that skips the UI and automatically detects firmware and launches the appropriate kernel exploit on open.

## Firmware Compatibility

| Component | Supported Firmware |
| :--- | :--- |
| Vue After Free (userland only) | 5.05–13.04 |
| Full jailbreak (this repo) | 7.00–13.00 |

- **7.00–12.02**: Lapse kernel exploit (default)
- **12.50–13.00**: Netctrl (Poopsploit) kernel exploit
- Poopsploit can optionally be used on firmwares as low as 9.00

<Aside type="caution">
Firmware 13.02 and above: userland runs, but no kernel exploit is available in this repo. Full jailbreak is not possible above 13.00.
</Aside>

## Required Parts

### All Methods
- PlayStation Vue 1.01 base + 1.24 patch (CUSA00960) — [Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/45owcabezln2ykm/CUSA00960.zip/file)
- Any network connection (internet not required — local WiFi, hotspot, ESP32, or Ethernet all work)
- HEN or GoldHEN payload binary named `payload.bin`
- USB flash drive formatted **MBR + exFAT**

### Jailbroken PS4 (Manual Method)
- FTP access to the console
- Apollo Save Tool — [Download](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-ps4/releases/latest)
- Fake or real PSN-activated user account

### Non-Jailbroken — Extended Storage Method
- USB drive, HDD, or SSD — **256 GB or larger**
- Internet connection on the PS4
- A way to resign a save file: jailbroken PS4, a Discord bot, or Save Wizard
- Fake or real PSN-activated user account
- balenaEtcher — [Download](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)

### Non-Jailbroken — System Backup Method
- USB flash drive formatted exFAT
- System backup file (included in `VueSystemBackup.7z` release)

<Aside type="danger">
The System Backup method erases all data on the console. Back up saves and captures to USB before proceeding if possible.
</Aside>

## Installation Difficulty

| Method | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- |
| Jailbroken PS4 (Manual) | Easy — requires FTP and Apollo Save Tool |
| Extended Storage + Save Resign | Moderate — requires save resigning and drive flashing with balenaEtcher |
| System Backup | Easy, but destructive — wipes all console data |

## Setup Overview

### Network Configuration (All Methods)

Vue requires a network connection but must be blocked from reaching Sony servers. Configure before launching Vue:

1. Disable automatic downloads: `Settings > System > Automatic Downloads` — uncheck Featured Content, System Software Update Files, and Application Update Files.
2. Go to `Settings > Network > Set Up Internet Connection > Custom`.
3. Set **IP Address** to `Automatic`, **DHCP Host Name** to `Do not Specify`.
4. Set **DNS Settings** to `Manual` and enter one of the following as Primary DNS (leave Secondary blank):

| DNS | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| `127.0.0.2` | Local network only — blocks all Sony traffic |
| `62.210.38.117` | Nomadic DNS — blocks Sony, allows general internet |

5. Set **MTU** to `Automatic`, **Proxy Server** to `Do Not Use`. Test the connection.

<Aside>
A failed internet connection test is expected and correct when using either DNS — it confirms Sony servers are being blocked.
</Aside>

### Jailbroken PS4

1. Jailbreak and enable FTP.
2. Fake-activate your account via Apollo Save Tool: `User Tools > Activate PS4 Accounts`, press R2, X, then O until prompted to exit to XMB. Accept, then reboot and jailbreak again.
3. Download `VueManualSetup.7z` (or `VueLiteManualSetup.7z`) from releases. Via FTP, place `download0.dat` at `/user/download/CUSA00960/` (create path if needed).
4. Unpack `save.zip` to USB (or FTP to `/data/fakeusb/`). In Apollo Save Tool, go to USB Saves, select the Vue save (CUSA00960), and choose **Copy save game to HDD**.
5. Place `payload.bin` (HEN or GoldHEN) in the USB root or `/data/`.
6. Install Vue 1.01 base then the 1.24 patch. Disable **Background Installation**. Reboot.
7. Open Vue, dismiss the PSN prompt, and press the jailbreak button (or configure autoloader/auto close).
8. Back up the Vue save file to USB via console settings. Resign an `OnlineSave` for recovery in case of data corruption.

<Aside>
If using HEN with Auto Close, edit `config.js` and add `20000` to the close delay before enabling it.
</Aside>

### Extended Storage (Non-Jailbroken)

1. Flash `VueExtImg.7z` (inside `VueExtStorage.7z`) to your 256 GB+ drive using balenaEtcher. It will appear stuck at 0% then 85–99% for several minutes — this is normal, do not interrupt.
2. On the PS4: `Settings > Storage > Extended Storage > Applications > [Options] > Move To System Storage`. Select the Vue app and confirm.
3. Resign the `OnlineSave` from `VueExtStorage.7z > OnlineSaveResign > CUSA00960` to your Account ID (find yours at `PS4/SAVEDATA/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` on any USB save).
4. Place the resigned save at `PS4/SAVEDATA/<AccountID>/CUSA00960` on USB. Place `payload.bin` in the USB root.
5. Import the save: `Settings > Application Saved Data Management > Saved Data on USB Storage Device > Copy to System Storage`.
6. Open Vue, dismiss the PSN prompt, and follow the on-screen setup to choose full or Lite mode.

### System Backup (Non-Jailbroken)

1. Format USB to exFAT. Unpack `VueSystemBackup.7z` (or `VueLiteSystemBackup.7z`) to its root.
2. Back up saves (`Settings > Application Saved Data Management > Saved Data in System Storage`) and captures (`Settings > Storage > System Storage > Capture Gallery > All`) to USB if accessible.
3. Restore: `Settings > System > Back Up and Restore > Restore PS4`. Select the system backup and confirm.
4. After reboot, configure network per above, place `payload.bin` on USB, then open Vue and run the exploit.

<Aside type="note">
The default system backup account ID is `1111111111111111`. To use a different account, create a new user after jailbreaking, fake-activate it with Apollo Save Tool, then follow the manual setup steps for that account.
</Aside>

## Payloads

Bundled payloads accessible from the Payload Menu:

| Payload | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ftp-server.ts` | Sandbox FTP — swap exploit or cosmetic files without a full jailbreak |
| `elfldr.elf` | Loads `.elf` and `.bin` payloads when HEN/GoldHEN are not present |
| `np-fake-signin` | Suppresses the PSN sign-in prompt on launch (fake accounts only) |
| `update.js` | Pulls latest repo files in-place (non-Lite builds only) |
| WebUI | Browser-based userland code execution example |

Additional `.bin` or `.elf` payloads can be auto-loaded after kernel exploit completion by editing `config.js`. HEN and GoldHEN load automatically from USB or `/data/` and should **not** be added to the auto-payload list.

Themes can be installed by copying a theme folder to `/download0/themes/`.

## Notes

- Back up the Vue save file to USB after every successful jailbreak via console settings.
- Do **not** change the NP environment via Debug Settings — it breaks save file compatibility and the fake sign-in payload.
- JS payloads require closing and reopening Vue between runs. `.bin` and `.elf` payloads can be run consecutively without restarting.
- App crash = exploit failed; shut down and retry. Console power-off = kernel panic; press power button twice to recover, then retry.
- If Vue updates unexpectedly, rebuild the database in Safe Mode, then follow the Extended Storage setup to reinstall.
