## Display Mods

### HDMI Output

- **RetroGEM** (PixelFX) — Internal HDMI output board for the GameCube. Widely discussed in the community; community member obieone noted completing installs on PS1, N64, and GameCube. Rear IO panel replacements designed for the RetroGEM are available on [Printables by BlueShell3D](https://www.printables.com/model/1244072-gamecube-replacement-rear-io-panels-for-retrogem).
- **GC Dual** — Another HDMI solution for GameCube. BlueShell3D also has rear IO panel replacements for the GC Dual on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/341725-gamecube-replacement-rear-io-panels). Community member GabeShack shared both panel designs.

### S-Video / Component

- **Insurrection Industries Double-Shielded S-Video Cable** — Covers SNES, N64, and GameCube. Good quality analog output option before committing to an HDMI mod. [Buy · Stone Age Gamer](https://stoneagegamer.com/super-nintendo-n64-gamecube-s-video-cable.html)
- The GameCube supports component video output via the Digital AV Out port on revisions that include it. Later revisions (DOL-101) removed the Digital AV Out.

## Storage / Optical Drive Emulators (ODE)

- **FlippyDrive** (Team OffBroadway) — SD card-based ODE for the GameCube. Actively followed in the community; multiple firmware update threads shared by RayneX and LoveMHz via CrowdSupply. Updates included batch shipping, FTP support, Bluetooth, compression, and a USB add-on. See [CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/team-offbroadway/flippydrive). A FlippyDrive SD extension is available from [Laser Bear](https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension). Community member Redherring32 noted receiving a FlippyDrive from Trevor for a GameCube portable build.
- **SD2SP2 / SD2SP2-Pro** — Micro SD card adapter using the GameCube's Serial Port 2. Allows running games via Swiss when combined with a compatible boot method. Open-source; see [GitHub (Extrems/SD2SP2)](https://github.com/Extrems/SD2SP2) and [SD2SP2-Pro (silverstee1)](https://github.com/silverstee1/SD2SP2-Pro).

## Controllers

- **GC Ultimate 2** (Mitch HHL) — Open-source, repair-friendly controller with hall effect sticks and triggers, gyro, analog triggers, and native Steam support. Designed for GameCube and N64 (and Nintendo Switch). Crowdfunding as of early 2026; ~$60–80. [gcultimate.com](https://gcultimate.com)

- **BlueRetro HW2 GameCube** (Arthrimus) — Internal Bluetooth wireless controller board designed for the GameCube. Open-source PCB. See [GitHub](https://github.com/Arthrimus/BlueRetro-HW2-GameCube).
- **USB to GameCube Adapter** (Robert Dale Smith) — Open-source USB to GameCube controller adapter. Covered by RetroRGB; see [retrorgb.com](https://www.retrorgb.com/open-source-usb-to-gamecube-adapter-from-robert-dale-smith.html).
- **GameCube Controller Connector with Breakout PCB** (Electron Shepherd) — PCB-mounted GameCube connector for controller port builds. Available from [electron-shepherd.com](https://electron-shepherd.com/collections/all/products/gamecube-connector-w-breakout-pcb).

## Networking

- **GCNET** (NeoStormer) — Ethernet networking solution for the GameCube. See [gcnet.neostormer.com](https://gcnet.neostormer.com).
- **ETH2SP1 Ethernet Adapter** — Swiss BBA (Broadband Adapter) alternative. Shared by Dubesinhower via [collabs.shop](https://collabs.shop/oc9bl8). Allows networked game loading via Swiss.
- **BBA (Broadband Adapter)** — Original Nintendo broadband adapter. Community member Muramasa noted finding one in a pile of GameCubes at a thrift store.

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Optical drive** — Standard disc drive failures as units age. Cleaning the laser lens is a first step; laser replacement follows.
- **GBA Link cable port** — The Game Boy Player link port can develop contact issues.
- **Capacitors** — Electrolytic caps on the power supply and audio subsystem can fail.
- **USB-C power mod** — Community member Reero mentioned a "USB-C GameCube power board that supports 12V and 15V" as a power supply mod option.

### Capacitor Replacement

- Main board and power supply board both have electrolytic caps worth inspecting on older units. The power supply board is a more common failure source.

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **Replacement rear IO panels** (BlueShell3D) — 3D-printed rear IO panel replacements fitting RetroGEM and GC Dual HDMI installations. Available on Printables.
- **3D-printed shells and enclosures** — Community member kak-hoofd mentioned using an Anycubic M3 Max for printing and verifying a GameCube model for Muramasa and Castlemania. Custom shell colors and modifications are discussed on BitBuilt.
- **Project Renaissance GameCube Portable** — A portable GameCube build project tracked on BitBuilt forums. Shared by GabeShack: see [BitBuilt thread](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/project-renaissance-a-modern-gamecube-portable.6922/).

## Shell & Cosmetics

<!-- DB:START section="Shell & Cosmetics" console=gamecube -->
- **[GCLoader SD Mount](https://www.laserbear.net/products/gc-loader-sd-mount)** by [Greg of Laser Bear](https://laserbear.net)
  A 3D-printed mount for the GCLoader ODE that installs into the GameCube disc bay opening. Presents the SD card slot where the disc would normally sit, with an SD extension cable routing the slot to an accessible position. Available in many color options including color-matched console variants. Turns the GCLoader ODE into a clean, integrated solution with easy SD card access. Eliminates the need to crack open the GameCube just to swap game libraries. $15-25.
- **[GameCube Drive Bay Cover](https://www.laserbear.net/products/gamecube-drive-bay-cover)** by [Greg of Laser Bear](https://laserbear.net)
  A 3D-printed cover for the GameCube optical drive bay. Provides a clean, flush look when the original disc drive has been replaced with an ODE. Compatible with GCLoader, CubeODE, and FlippyDrive. Pairs with the FlippyDrive SD Extension for SD access via the light pipe position. Completes the aesthetic of an ODE build — no unsightly open bay or mismatched panels. A simple cosmetic essential for clean ODE GameCube builds. $5-15.
- **[GameCube Rear IO Panels (RetroGEM / GC Dual)](https://www.printables.com/model/1244072-gamecube-replacement-rear-io-panels-for-retrogem)** by [BlueShell3D](https://x.com/BlueShell3D)
  3D-printed replacement rear IO panels for the GameCube, with cutouts specifically designed for RetroGEM and GC Dual HDMI installs.

## Accessories

<!-- DB:START section="Accessories" console=gamecube -->
- **[FlippyDrive SD Extension](https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension)** by [Greg of Laser Bear](https://laserbear.net)
  A kit that replaces the light pipe in the top of the GameCube with an SD card slot. Makes it easy to access and swap the FlippyDrive SD card without opening the console. Includes a 3D-printed clear resin housing and flex PCB. The FlippyDrive's SD card is otherwise buried inside the console. This gives users convenient external access for game management and firmware updates without repeated disassembly. $10-25.
- **[ETH2SP1 GameCube Ethernet Adapter](https://www.laserbear.net/products/gamecube-eth2sp1-ethernet-adapter-for-swiss-bba-alternative)** by [Greg of Laser Bear](https://laserbear.net)
  An SPI Ethernet adapter for the GameCube that connects to Serial Port 1, providing a modern BBA (Broadband Adapter) alternative. Built on the Wiznet W5500 module for higher interface speeds than typical ENC28J60-based adapters. Snaps into the bottom bay of the GameCube with the Ethernet jack accessible from the side — just like the original BBA. Original BBA units are rare and expensive. This gives GameCube owners an affordable way to do LAN multiplayer in Double Dash, Kirby Air Ride, 1080° Avalanche, and online Phantasy Star Online via private servers. $20-40.
- **[SD2SP1 GameCube SD Adapter](https://www.laserbear.net/products/gamecube-sd2sp1-sd-card-adapter-for-serial-port-1)** by [Greg of Laser Bear](https://laserbear.net)
  An SD card adapter for the GameCube Serial Port 1 (SP1) on the base of the console. Provides an SD card interface accessible by Swiss homebrew. Useful for GameCubes that lack an SP2 port. Allows SD card game loading via Swiss on consoles without a Serial Port 2 slot, expanding compatibility for ODE-free homebrew setups. $5-15.
