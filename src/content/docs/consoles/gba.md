## Display Mods

### IPS / LCD Screen Replacements

- **FunnyPlaying IPS v2** — One of the most widely discussed drop-in IPS kits. Requires minor shell trimming on AGB-001. Noted for brightness and colour accuracy.
- **FunnyPlaying Q5 XL** — Larger screen that fills more of the shell window. Requires more trimming. Popular in the community for the larger viewing area.
- **Hispeedido IPS** — Budget alternative. Mixed community feedback on colour reproduction compared to FunnyPlaying.
- **One Chip IPS** — Mentioned periodically as an alternative; less community discussion than FunnyPlaying options.

**SP-specific:**
- **AGS-101 backlit screen swap** — Installing an AGS-101 (backlit) screen into an AGS-001 (frontlit) shell is a classic mod. Requires a ribbon cable adapter.

## Storage / Flash Carts

- **EverDrive GBA X5 Mini** (Krikzz) — Frequently recommended in the community. SD card-based, supports most ROMs, RTC support for games that need it.
- **EZFlash Omega Definitive Edition** — Alternative to EverDrive. Slightly different feature set; community discussion around save state support.
- **EZFlash Jr.** — For Game Boy / Game Boy Color only (not GBA). Sometimes mentioned alongside GBA carts in general flash cart discussions.

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Capacitors** — Electrolytic caps on the power board can fail over time, causing audio buzz or power instability. Recapping is a common fix.
- **Speaker** — Original speakers degrade. Replacements are widely available and straightforward to swap.
- **Power switch** — Can become intermittent with age. Cleaning with IPA or replacement.
- **Headphone jack** — Prone to crackle; cleaning or replacement.

### Shell / Screen Lens Condition
- Scratched lenses are common. Replacement lenses are cheap and available from multiple suppliers.

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **Funnyplaying shells** — Most discussed shell replacement source. Wide colour selection, generally good fit.
- **Hispeedido shells** — Budget option; mixed feedback on fit and finish.
- **RetroSix CleanJuice** — USB-C rechargeable battery mod. Replaces AA batteries.

## Community Notes

- Shell trimming requirements vary between IPS kit brands and shell sources — confirm compatibility before buying.
- Some IPS kits require soldering touch sensor wires for brightness control; others are truly drop-in.
- The AGS-101 screen swap into AGS-001 is considered a "classic" mod but requires sourcing a used AGS-101 for the screen, which adds cost.
