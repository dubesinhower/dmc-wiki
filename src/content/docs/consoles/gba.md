## Display Mods

### IPS / LCD Screen Replacements

- **FunnyPlaying IPS v2** — One of the most widely discussed drop-in IPS kits for the AGB-001. Noted for brightness and colour accuracy. Requires minor shell trimming on most shells. Some kits include touch sensor wires for brightness/colour control; others are truly drop-in. [Buy · FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gbа-ips-v2)

- **FunnyPlaying Q5 XL IPS** — Larger screen that fills more of the shell window. More popular for the larger viewing area, but requires more shell trimming than the standard IPS v2. Confirm shell compatibility before buying. [Buy · FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gba-q5-ips-backlight-kit)

- **Hispeedido IPS** — Budget alternative to FunnyPlaying kits. Mixed community feedback on colour reproduction. Good option if cost is the primary concern. [Buy · AliExpress (search "Hispeedido GBA IPS")](https://www.aliexpress.com)

- **One Chip IPS** — Mentioned periodically as an alternative; less community discussion than FunnyPlaying options. [Buy · HandHeld Legend](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-advance/products/game-boy-advance-ips-lcd)

**SP-specific:**
- **AGS-101 backlit screen swap** — Installing an AGS-101 (backlit) screen into an AGS-001 (frontlit) shell is a classic mod. Requires a ribbon cable adapter. The AGS-101 screen must be sourced from a donor unit or aftermarket supplier. [Adapter · HandHeld Legend](https://handheldlegend.com/collections/game-boy-advance-sp)

## Storage / Flash Carts

- **EverDrive GBA X5 Mini** (Krikzz) — Frequently recommended. SD card-based, supports most ROMs, includes RTC support for games that require it (Pokémon, etc.). Compact form factor fits flush in the cartridge slot. [Buy · Krikzz](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/edgba.html)

- **EZFlash Omega Definitive Edition** — Alternative to EverDrive. Notable for save state support and a slightly different feature set. Community discussions mention occasional compatibility quirks compared to EverDrive. [Buy · EZFlash](https://www.ezflash.cn/product/ez-flash-omega-definitive-edition/)

- **EZFlash Jr.** — Designed for original Game Boy and Game Boy Color, not GBA. Sometimes mentioned alongside GBA carts in general flash cart discussions — confirm you're buying the right cart for your system. [Buy · EZFlash](https://www.ezflash.cn/product/ezflash-junior/)

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Power board capacitors** — Electrolytic caps on the power board can fail over time, causing audio buzz or power instability. Recapping is a common fix. Replacement cap kits are available from RetroSix and similar suppliers.

- **Speaker** — Original speakers degrade with age, producing thin or crackling audio. Replacements are inexpensive and widely available. Straightforward swap — no special tools required. [Buy · FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gba-replacement-speaker)

- **Power switch** — Can become intermittent with age. Cleaning with isopropyl alcohol often restores function; if not, direct replacement is cheap and easy.

- **Headphone jack** — Prone to crackle and dropout. Cleaning with IPA is first step; replacement is an option if cleaning doesn't resolve it.

### Shell / Screen Lens Condition
- Scratched lenses are common on used units. Replacement lenses are inexpensive and available from multiple suppliers. [Buy · FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gba-replacement-lens)

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **FunnyPlaying Shells** — Most discussed shell replacement source in the community. Wide colour selection, generally good fit. Available with or without screen lens cutout for IPS mods. [Buy · FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com/collections/product/products/gba-retro-pixel-ips-ready-shell)

- **Hispeedido Shells** — Budget option. Mixed feedback on fit and finish compared to FunnyPlaying; some users report minor alignment issues. [Buy · AliExpress (search "Hispeedido GBA shell")](https://www.aliexpress.com)

- **RetroSix CleanJuice** — USB-C rechargeable battery mod. Replaces the two AA batteries with a rechargeable Li-ion cell. Adds USB-C charging port accessible from outside the shell. [Buy · RetroSix](https://retrosix.co.uk/CleanJuice-Game-Boy-Advance-USB-C-Battery-Mod-p309441418)

## Community Notes

- Shell trimming requirements vary between IPS kit brands and shell sources — confirm compatibility before buying.
- Some IPS kits require soldering touch sensor wires for brightness/colour control; others are truly drop-in. Product listings usually specify.
- The AGS-101 screen swap into AGS-001 is considered a "classic" mod but requires sourcing a used AGS-101, which adds cost vs. a modern IPS kit.
