- **[openMenu](https://github.com/DerekPascarella/openMenu)** by [Derek Pascarella](https://x.com/DerekPascarella)
  Feature-rich Dreamcast disc management system. Works with GD-ROM, GDEMU, MODE, USB-GDROM, and SD card. Supports virtual per-game VMUs, built-in updater, and Windows/Linux tooling. The most capable Dreamcast ODE frontend available. More features than MODE or USB-GDROM software. v1.5 in late beta as of February 2026, adding per-game virtual VMUs without needing VMUPro. Open source.

- **[VMUPro](https://8bitmods.com)** by [8BitMods](https://x.com/8bitmods)
  A digital replacement for the Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit). Stores all save data digitally, with game-aware auto-switching. Regular firmware updates. Original VMU batteries die and screens fail. VMUPro is the definitive modern replacement, maintained with an active firmware update cycle. OS v1.3.6 released February 2026. ~$40–50.
