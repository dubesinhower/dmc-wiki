## Display Mods

### HDMI / RGB Output

- **RetroGEM** (PixelFX) — Universal internal HDMI mod kit covering PS1, PS2, and N64. Widely installed in the community; active firmware development ongoing. Note: a border/overlay in PS1 and PS2 builds has been observed by community members — firmware revisions continue to address this. PSOne and PU-8 board compatibility was mentioned as "in consideration."

## Storage / Flash Carts

- PS1 uses optical disc media; flash carts in the traditional sense are not standard. See ODE section below.

## Optical Drive Emulators (ODE)

- **PSIO** (Cybdyn Systems) — One of the earliest widely-used PS1 ODEs. Connects via the parallel port on select revisions. Community member bahamutfan linked to PSIO news updates ([psio.cybdyn-systems.com.au](https://psio.cybdyn-systems.com.au/news-2024/)). A PSIO-in-PSOne conversion has been documented at [GitHub (tzmwx)](https://github.com/tzmwx/PSIO-IN-PSONE).
- **SD2IDE** (PhenomMod / Mena) — Ongoing project targeting SD card to IDE interface for PS1. Community member RayneX tracked PSX boot progress: "SD2IDE progress on the PSX. Boot logo achieved." in Discord.
- **PS1 Disc-Based Game ID patches** (jdfr228) — BIOS patches to allow disc-based game ID; related to ODE and backup compatibility. See [GitHub](https://github.com/jdfr228/PS1-Disc-Based-Game-ID).

## Modchips

- **PSnee** — Open-source software modchip project with wide hardware support. Runs on common cheap microcontrollers (ATtiny, PIC). [GitHub](https://github.com/kalymos/PSnee)
- **Delta PSnee QSB** — A compact quick-solder board implementation of PSnee. Available from [delta-island.com](https://delta-island.com/index.php/en/tutorials/playstation-delta-psnee-qsb).
- **tehUberChip** (L10N37) — Another open-source PS1 modchip. See [GitHub](https://github.com/L10N37/tehUberChip_Another_PSX_Modchip).

## Memory Cards

- **MemCard PRO** (8BitMods) — Digital memory card replacement for PS1 with game-aware auto-switching. Available from Rondo Products ([rondoproducts.com](https://rondoproducts.com/products/memcard-pro)). Linked by community member hardbroiled; actively discussed in the community around pre-order and multi-product shipping groupings.

## Common Repairs

### Known Failure Points

- **Optical drive laser** — The laser assembly wears out over time. Potentiometer adjustment can extend life; laser replacement is a common repair.
- **Disc tray mechanism** — The drive gears and belt degrade. Replacement belts and gear sets are widely available.
- **Capacitors** — Power supply caps age and affect stability. Community member RGBeter discussed PS1 power supply design and a mod to prevent the supply from running continuously when plugged in.
- **Controller and memory card ports** — Connector wear; cleaning and pin-bending can restore contact.

### Capacitor Replacement

- Relevant on both the main board and power supply board. PSOne (later slim revision) boards have a somewhat different layout. A first-ever PS1 motherboard replacement effort was linked from Reddit (r/retrogaming) in the community.

## Shell / Cosmetic Mods

- **Translucent PS1 shells** (Muramasa Entertainment) — Replacement shells for the PlayStation in translucent red and other colors. Shared by community member Fenris Wolf Retro.
- **nsOne** — A custom PS1 motherboard project (Kickstarter by lawrencebrd) that aims to create a modernized replacement mainboard. Discussed in community as an emerging project.

## Controllers

- **Project Medusa** (Will's Console Modifications) — Internal BlueRetro kit for PS1, enabling Bluetooth wireless controller support. See [willsconsolemodifications.co.uk](https://www.willsconsolemodifications.co.uk).
- **8BitDo Retro Receiver for PS1/PS2** — Dongle-style wireless receiver allowing modern 8BitDo and compatible controllers to work on PS1 hardware. [Buy · 8BitDo](https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-receiver-playstation/)
