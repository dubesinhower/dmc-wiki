## About This Wiki

This wiki is a synthesis of knowledge shared in the [Bleeding Retro Discord community](https://discord.gg/bleedingretro) over several years.

**What you'll find here:**
- Possible mods and upgrades for retro consoles
- Common repairs and known failure points
- Community context on tools, products, and techniques

**What this wiki is not:**
- A ranking of "best" mods — we list options, not verdicts
- A replacement for hands-on research — always read up before you solder

> Options are listed without ranking. What works best depends on your hardware revision, budget, and skill level.
