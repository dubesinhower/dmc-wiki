## What This Is

This wiki synthesizes years of knowledge shared in the Bleeding Retro Discord community. It covers possible mods, repairs, and upgrades for retro consoles.

## How to Read It

**No rankings.** Options are listed without a "best" label. What works for one person's budget, skill level, and hardware revision may not work for another.

**Context labels** help you understand the nature of each option:
- *Widely discussed* — comes up often in community conversation
- *Budget option* — lower cost, may involve trade-offs
- *Open source* — schematics/files publicly available
- *Revision-specific* — only works on certain hardware versions
- *Known issue* — community has flagged problems worth knowing about

## How It's Built

Pages are synthesized from community discussions and updated periodically. This is not a manually curated encyclopaedia — it reflects what the community actually talks about.

## Something Missing or Wrong?

This wiki is a prototype. If a page is incomplete or inaccurate, the best place to flag it is in the [Bleeding Retro Discord](https://discord.gg/bleedingretro).
