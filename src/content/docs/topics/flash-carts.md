title: Flash Carts
description: Flash cartridges for retro consoles — load ROM libraries from SD card on original hardware.
---

> Flash carts let you play your ROM library from a single cartridge on original hardware. They're one of the most practical upgrades for retro gaming, letting you preserve shelf space while keeping the authentic hardware experience.

## Overview

A flash cartridge accepts an SD or microSD card loaded with ROM images and presents them to the console as if a real cartridge were inserted. Quality flash carts run on original hardware with full compatibility, save support, and often extra features like in-game menus, real-time clocks, and cheat code support. The community widely discusses Krikzz as the dominant flash cart developer and manufacturer — members have been buying his products since his earliest releases.
