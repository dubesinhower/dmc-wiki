title: Flash Carts
description: Flash cartridges for retro consoles — load ROM libraries from SD card on original hardware.
---

> Flash carts let you play your ROM library from a single cartridge on original hardware. They're one of the most practical upgrades for retro gaming, letting you preserve shelf space while keeping the authentic hardware experience.

## Overview

A flash cartridge accepts an SD or microSD card loaded with ROM images and presents them to the console as if a real cartridge were inserted. Quality flash carts run on original hardware with full compatibility, save support, and often extra features like in-game menus, real-time clocks, and cheat code support. The community widely discusses Krikzz (krikzz.com) as the dominant flash cart developer and manufacturer — members have been buying his products since his earliest releases.

## Options / Products

### Krikzz EverDrive Line

Krikzz (@krikzz / @krikzzstore) makes EverDrive carts for most major systems. Community members consider his products the reference standard.

- **EverDrive GB X3 / X7** — Game Boy flash carts. The X3 is the budget-tier option; the X7 adds more features. Community member asie owns an X3 and notes the tradeoffs.
- **Mega EverDrive / Mega EverDrive Pro** — For Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. The Pro adds Sega CD emulation, but is not compatible with some ODE-based Sega CD implementations (e.g., MODE). The cheaper X5 tier covers the entire Genesis and 32x library for those not needing Sega CD.
- **EverDrive N8 (NES)** — NES flash cart; Helder received one and tested new firmware.
- **Turbo EverDrive** — For PC-Engine / TurboGrafx-16.
- **EverDrive 64** — For N64. Works alongside the Retro GEM.

### Other Notable Flash Carts

- **FXPak Pro (sd2snes)** — Super Nintendo flash cart. Widely discussed; supports enhancement chips and expansion firmware.
- **MR Cart (Virtual Boy)** — Made by RetroOnyx (Kevin). A flash cart for the Virtual Boy — sold in limited batches. Batch 2 and Batch 3 preorders were discussed in the community. An aluminum-shell version was shipped in late 2025. RayneX shared preorder links repeatedly.
- **NileSwan (WonderSwan)** — In-progress WonderSwan flash cart, developed with asie (who is also involved in the companion ws-cartfriend software). Features include WonderWitch support, accelerometer, USB port, and a 3D-printed case. A budget option compared to Krikzz's future WS cart.
- **BeeX** — A PC-Engine / TG-16 flash cart (flash-via-USB style). Discussed as a potential Turbo EverDrive alternative.
- **iQue Player card** — The iQue Player has a built-in "flash cart" by default (discussed by Redherring32 and zwenergy).
- **ws-cartfriend** — Open source WonderSwan cart manager software by asie (GitHub: `asiekierka/ws-cartfriend`).

### Distributors

- **Stone Age Gamer (SAG)** — Major US flash cart retailer. Carries EverDrives, MegaSD, and accessories. Community members reference SAG for pricing and stock.
- **krikzz.com** — Direct purchase; Krikzz also maintains a public firmware repo at `krikzz.com/pub/support/`.

## Community Notes

- Krikzz is widely respected in this community. SurrealCerebralCereal: *"Krikzz is the freakin GOAT man. That guy deserves all the money."*
- starlightk7 has a long history with Krikzz products, going back to his earliest releases. She noted being offended by comments Krikzz made about certain communities but contextualizes it within broader industry standards.
- There is documented tension between Krikzz and Analogue. Krikzz shipped a firmware update in 2025 that addressed compatibility issues between EverDrives and Analogue systems; starlightk7 noted that Analogue users had been sending "nasty" messages to Krikzz about issues with their devices.
- The Mega EverDrive Pro is **not compatible** with flash cart-based Sega CD implementations. This is a known limitation — Dubesinhower asked about disabling those features; Krikzz confirmed it would require a ground-up rewrite.
- An EverDrive X5 covers the full Genesis + 32x library for roughly $40–60, making it a budget-accessible entry point per Vuscav.
- The Neptune (community Genesis/32x combo board) has compatibility quirks with flash carts for CD games; community members hoped for a future switch to disable 32x mode for CD loading.
- Flash carts with SD extenders are used in some portable/embedded setups for externally accessible card slots.
- Community debate: *"Why buy an Analogue system only to use a flash cart, when you could just use a MiSTer?"* — Kytor, April 2025.
