title: 3D Printing
description: 3D printing for retro hardware — shells, cases, mounts, brackets, and accessories for modded consoles.

> 3D printing has become a core part of retro hardware modding. From replacement console shells to custom back panels for HDMI mods, community members design and print parts that don't exist commercially — and share them on Printables for others to use.

## Overview

Retro hardware modding often requires custom enclosures, brackets, and mounting solutions that don't exist off the shelf. 3D printing fills this gap: printer owners design parts for specific mod configurations and publish the files on Printables.com or share them directly. The community uses both FDM (filament) and resin printers, depending on the detail level and scale required. Community member kak-hoofd is an active designer with multiple community-relevant models published.

## Common Applications

### Replacement Shells & Panels

- **GameCube Rear IO Panels** — Custom back panels for GameCube, including specific variants for the Retro GEM HDMI install (with mini-HDMI cutout). Multiple designs by community member BonboMods and others on Printables. Blueshell3D (@blueshell3d.com) designs GameCube back panels with HDMI and Ethernet port cutouts for FlippyDrive + GEM builds.
- **PS2 Phat GEM Mount** — A no-cut, no-part-removal mount for the PixelFX GEM on PS2 Phat, designed to preserve the original hardware. Shared by RayneX (March 2025).
- **Game Boy / GBC / GBA Shells** — Various shell replacements available on Printables. Community member kak-hoofd published a classic DMG-01 shell.
- **Game Gear Shells** — retro6 and Retro Modding have started carrying new injection-molded Game Gear shells. kak-hoofd noted it as a possible future print candidate.
- **VMU Replacement Shells** — VMU shells available at vgnysoft.com as injection-molded replacements.
- **OMVS (Open MVS Shell)** — An AES-inspired shell for the Neo Geo MV1C consolizer. Published by kak-hoofd on Printables (model/79126). Designed and verified using an Anycubic M3 Max resin printer.
- **N64 DD Replacement Shell** — Available on Printables (model/1145937).
- **SC64 Shell (smoke black)** — Tubo and Bonzo discussed smoke black injection-molded SC64 shells from the manufacturer.
- **360 Shell (smoke black)** — RayneX referenced an Xbox 360 shell run done by Tubo's contact.

### Mod-Specific Brackets & Mounts

- **NileSwan Case (3D Printed)** — The WonderSwan flash cart NileSwan ships with a 3D-printed case in early production; asie noted that batch size limits prevent injection molding for now.
- **MR Cart Virtual Boy** — Aluminum-shell version of the Virtual Boy flash cart (RetroOnyx). An earlier version used a 3D-printed shell.
- **MSDEXP Case** — Mobius Strip Technologies sells an injection-molded replacement case for the MegaSD Expansion (MSDEXP). Previously 3D printed; injection molding signals serious production intent.
- **N64 Controller Pak** — Bonzo published a 3D printable N64 Controller Pak on Printables (model/846898).
- **DS "Slab" (GBA Macro)** — A GBA Macro design using Nintendo DS parts by xipher, published on Printables (model/174642). Dubesinhower shared this.
- **Virtual Ribbon V4 LED PCB Holder** — For Virtual Boy; on Printables (model/498157).
- **Retro Bit Saturn Controller Holder** — Printable controller stand (model/1120105).
- **SP1ETH Ethernet Case** — A case for the GameCube SP1ETH ethernet board by silverstee1 (GitHub: `silverstee1/SP1ETH`).
- **Morph 4K Vertical Stand** — Vertical stand for the PixelFX Morph 4K upscaler on Printables (model/892683).
- **TapTo NFC Tandy Remix** — A remixed NFC reader enclosure for the Zaparoo/TapTo MiSTer launcher (model/804654).
- **Computer Space Replica Cabinet** — Full-size printable arcade cabinet replica (model/873690).

### Accessories & Small Parts

- **Cartridge Shells (GBA)** — Hoskinson Industries makes clear GBA cartridge shells with logos; also available for other formats.
- **Virtual Boy MrCart** — Aluminum shell production cart; aluminum for durability vs. 3D printed originals.
- **Saturn Bluetooth Controller PCB Holder** — Kytor designed an enclosure for a Retro Bit Saturn wireless/Bluetooth mod.

## Tools & Printers Discussed

- **Anycubic M3 Max** — Large resin printer used by kak-hoofd for model verification and OMVS shell work. Noted as one of the larger home resin options (~300mm+ in all dimensions is rare for home resin).
- **Neptune 4 Max** — FDM printer referenced by RayneX for large prints (e.g., Xbox prototype shell would require ~4kg of filament).
- **Carbon Fiber Filament (CF Filament)** — Dubesinhower suggested CF filament for a GameCube nintendrawer-style application for added rigidity.
- **Resin vs. FDM** — Community members generally prefer resin for fine-detail shell work and use FDM for brackets, mounts, and functional parts.
- **China resin printing services** — Tubo noted he'd need China-based printing services for large resin pieces that exceed home printer capacity.

## Community Members & Designers

- **kak-hoofd** — Active community member and designer. Published the OMVS shell (AES-inspired for MV1C consolizer), GameBoy DMG-01 shell, and others. Uses Anycubic M3 Max.
- **Blueshell3D (@blueshell3d.com / @blueshell3d on Bluesky)** — Designs GameCube IO panels. Tuned the GEM back panel design to include both HDMI and Ethernet cutouts for FlippyDrive builds.
- **BonboMods** — Community member with multiple models on Printables including GameCube IO panels.
- **castlemaniaryan / Castle Mania Games** — RayneX and Dubesinhower share CastleMania's work frequently. They produce custom retro hardware accessories including printed parts.

## Community Notes

- Community members generally share models on Printables.com rather than Thingiverse.
- Injection molding is the long-term goal for popular designs — community members track when projects move from 3D-printed prototypes to injection-molded production (MSDEXP, NileSwan, MR Cart) as a sign of project maturity.
- kak-hoofd: *"Guess I'll add that to the list of shells to make."* — Community designers actively take requests.
- Tubo is known for reshelling hardware in smoke black. RayneX: *"Everyone offering their smoke shells. Do we need to fund a 'Shell Anonymous for smoking'?"*
- starlightk7 mentioned dedicated automated PCB printing machines (a few thousand dollars) for home prototype board production — a step beyond typical FDM/resin printing.
- Custom shells are often paired with other mods: a FlippyDrive + GEM GameCube needs a back panel with both Ethernet and HDMI cutouts, which didn't exist commercially until Blueshell3D created one.
