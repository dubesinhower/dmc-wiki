Open source IDE/ATAPI drive emulator built on the Raspberry Pi RP2350. Replaces aging hard drives and CD-ROM drives in vintage computers with microSD card storage. Loads .bin/.cue and .iso images. Correctly handles redbook CD audio — something DOS software solutions cannot do.

## Updates

- **2026-02-25** — Thanks! It’s a core part of my testing because it’s set to 24-hour time and whenever I do a bus capture the file gets timestamped in that format. So it’s very useful to know “wtf is the current hour” 
- **2026-02-25** — New update on the Crowd Supply #PicoIDE campaign, all about how important my beta testers have been in making it work: www.crowdsupply.com/polpotronics...
