A DIY SNES video enhancement kit that sharpens the SNES video output by boosting edge definition. Sold as a kit; install is streamed by Voultar. Note: community investigation ongoing (as of Feb 2026) into whether it can stress the PPU2 analog DAC under certain conditions.

## Overview

A popular and widely discussed SNES video mod from one of the most prominent SNES modders in the community. The ongoing PPU2 concern is active community discussion.

## Details

- **Type:** Hardware Mod
- **Status:** Active
- **Open Source:** No
- **Price range:** Unknown
- **Consoles:** [SNES](/consoles/snes)

## Creator(s)

- **[Voultar](/creators/voultar)**

## Updates

- **2026-02-25** — On a more positive note, I am hard at work on prepping the next two SNES consoles for sale! These will not have the SNEdge installed, and as a result will be $20 cheaper than the last batch.
